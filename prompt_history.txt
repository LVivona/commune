bootstrap prompt: Prior Zelda games have employed a theme of two separate, yet connected, worlds. In A Link to the Past, Link travels between a "Light World" and a "Dark World"; in Ocarina of Time, as well as in Oracle of Ages, Link travels between two different time periods. The Zelda team sought to reuse this motif in the series' latest installment. It was suggested that Link transform into a wolf, much like he metamorphoses into a rabbit in the Dark World of A Link to the Past.[m] The story of the game was created by Aonuma, and later underwent several changes by scenario writers Mitsuhiro Takano and Aya Kyogoku. Takano created the script for the story scenes, while Kyogoku and Takayuki Ikkaku handled the actual in-game script. Aonuma left his team working on the new idea while he directed The Minish Cap for the Game Boy Advance. When he returned, he found the Twilight Princess team struggling. Emphasis on the parallel worlds and the wolf transformation had made Link's character unbelievable. Aonuma also felt the gameplay lacked the caliber of innovation found in Phantom Hourglass, which was being developed with touch controls for the Nintendo DS. At the same time, the Wii was under development with the code name "Revolution". Miyamoto thought that the Revolution's pointing device, the Wii Remote, was well suited for aiming arrows in Zelda, and suggested that Aonuma consider using it.[n]

They also state that since successors of lamas granted the title of "prince" had to travel to the Ming court to renew this title, and since lamas called themselves princes, the Ming court therefore had "full sovereignty over Tibet." They state that the Ming dynasty, by issuing imperial edicts to invite ex-Yuan officials to the court for official positions in the early years of its founding, won submission from ex-Yuan religious and administrative leaders in the Tibetan areas, and thereby incorporated Tibetan areas into the rule of the Ming court. Thus, they conclude, the Ming court won the power to rule Tibetan areas formerly under the rule of the Yuan dynasty.

bootstrap prompt: Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but more than 200 children escaped harm due to efforts of the New York City Police Department, which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants. According to historian James M. McPherson (2001), at least 120 people were killed. In all, eleven black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of blacks to flee the city for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, as well as New Jersey; the black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865, which it had last been in 1820. The white working class had established dominance. Violence by longshoremen against black men was especially fierce in the docks area. It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.

The riots also led to increased segregation and discrimination against black New Yorkers. Many black-owned businesses were destroyed during the riots, and many black residents were forced to move to less desirable areas of the city. The riots also led to increased violence against black New Yorkers, as white mobs targeted black men and women for assault and murder. The riots were a significant setback for the African American community in New York City, and it would take many years for the community to recover from the damage caused by the riots.
123 | Q score(2.5251): What were the main causes of the Draft Riots in New York City?

bootstrap prompt: Hydrogen production technologies been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s. Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several thermochemical processes have also been explored. One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures (2,300–2,600 °C or 4,200–4,700 °F). Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods. Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production. The Solzinc process under development at the Weizmann Institute uses a 1 MW solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide (ZnO) at temperatures above 1,200 °C (2,200 °F). This initial reaction produces pure zinc, which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen.

124 | A score(1.0591): Solar-based hydrogen production methods have several advantages over conventional methods. First, they are renewable and do not require the use of fossil fuels. Second, they can be used in remote locations where access to electricity is limited. Third, they can be used to produce hydrogen on-demand, which is not possible with conventional methods. Finally, they can be used to produce hydrogen at lower temperatures, which reduces the risk of explosion and makes the process more efficient.
125 | Q score(2.365): What are some of the challenges in implementing solar-based hydrogen production methods on a larger scale?
125 | A score(0.7952): One of the main challenges in implementing solar-based hydrogen production methods on a larger scale is the need for high-temperature materials that can withstand the extreme conditions required for thermochemical processes. Additionally, the high cost of solar concentrators and the need for efficient heat management systems make these technologies less economically viable compared to conventional hydrogen production methods. Another challenge is the need for efficient water splitting catalysts that can operate under the harsh conditions of thermochemical processes. Finally, the need for large-scale storage and transportation of hydrogen presents a significant challenge for widespread adoption of solar-based hydrogen production technologies.
126 | Q score(1.2822): What are some potential solutions to these challenges?
126 | A score(1.0688): Some potential solutions to the challenges of harnessing solar energy include increasing the efficiency of solar panels, developing better energy storage technologies, expanding the use of solar power in homes and businesses, and investing in large-scale solar power plants.

bootstrap prompt: Jonathan Bellman writes that modern concert performance style—set in the "conservatory" tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings—militates against what is known of Chopin's more intimate performance technique. The composer himself said to a pupil that "concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art." Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as "always crescendo to a high note", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring. Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin "has created a kind of chromatic embroidery ... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe ... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn". Hiller wrote that "What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers."
127 | Q score(2.7681): What specific techniques did Chopin use in his intimate performance style?

bootstrap prompt: Gautama first went to study with famous religious teachers of the day, and mastered the meditative attainments they taught. But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering, so he continued his quest. He next attempted an extreme asceticism, which was a religious pursuit common among the śramaṇas, a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one. Gautama underwent prolonged fasting, breath-holding, and exposure to pain. He almost starved himself to death in the process. He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit, and had not put an end to suffering. So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach. He devoted himself to anapanasati meditation, through which he discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way (Skt. madhyamā-pratipad): a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification.[web 2][web 3]
157 | Q score(1.3555): What is anapanasati meditation and how did it help Gautama discover the Middle Way?
157 | A score(0.8253): Anapanasati is a type of mindfulness meditation that focuses on the breath. In this practice, one observes the sensation of the breath as it enters and leaves the body, and gently brings one's attention back to the breath when it wanders. This practice helps to cultivate awareness and concentration, and can lead to a deep sense of calm and relaxation.

Gautama discovered the Middle Way through his practice of anapanasati meditation. He realized that the extreme ascetic practices he had tried before were not the answer to ending suffering. Instead, he found that a balanced approach to life, with moderation and mindfulness, was the key to achieving liberation from suffering. By focusing on the breath and cultivating awareness and concentration through anapanasati meditation, Gautama was able to develop a deep understanding of the nature of reality and the true nature of the self. This understanding led him to the realization that the path to liberation from suffering was not through extreme practices, but through a balanced and mindful approach to life.

bootstrap prompt: Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the Solar Total Energy Project (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400 kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401 kW steam and 468 kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage. Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation. The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from sea water is one of the oldest applications of solar energy. Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams. Clothes lines, clotheshorses, and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas. In some states of the United States legislation protects the "right to dry" clothes. Unglazed transpired collectors (UTC) are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air. UTCs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22 °C (40 °F) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45–60 °C (113–140 °F). The short payback period of transpired collectors (3 to 12 years) makes them a more cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems. As of 2003, over 80 systems with a combined collector area of 35,000 square metres (380,000 sq ft) had been installed worldwide, including an 860 m2 (9,300 sq ft) collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1,300 m2 (14,000 sq ft) collector in Coimbatore, India, used for drying marigolds.

bootstrap prompt: Scholars have characterized To Kill a Mockingbird as both a Southern Gothic and coming-of-age or Bildungsroman novel. The grotesque and near-supernatural qualities of Boo Radley and his house, and the element of racial injustice involving Tom Robinson contribute to the aura of the Gothic in the novel. Lee used the term "Gothic" to describe the architecture of Maycomb's courthouse and in regard to Dill's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley. Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem's questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to Catcher in the Rye and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Despite challenging the town's systems, Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one's conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is social ostracism. However, scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification, noting that Boo Radley is in fact human, protective, and benevolent. Furthermore, in addressing themes such as alcoholism, incest, rape, and racial violence, Lee wrote about her small town realistically rather than melodramatically. She portrays the problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues in every society.

 France: The torch relay leg in Paris, held on April 7, began on the first level of the Eiffel Tower and finished at the Stade Charléty. The relay was initially supposed to cover 28 km, but it was shortened at the demand of Chinese officials following widespread protests by pro-Tibet and human rights activists, who repeatedly attempted to disrupt, hinder or halt the procession. A scheduled ceremony at the town hall was cancelled at the request of the Chinese authorities, and, also at the request of Chinese authorities, the torch finished the relay by bus instead of being carried by athletes. Paris City officials had announced plans to greet the Olympic flame with peaceful protest when the torch was to reach the French capital. The city government attached a banner reading "Paris defends human rights throughout the world" to the City Hall, in an attempt to promote values "of all humanity and of human rights." Members from Reporters Without Borders turned out in large numbers to protest. An estimated 3,000 French police protected the Olympic torch relay as it departed from the Eiffel Tower and criss-crossed Paris amid threat of protests. Widespread pro-Tibet protests, including an attempt by more than one demonstrator to extinguish the flame with water or fire extinguishers, prompted relay authorities to put out the flame five times (according to the police authorities in Paris) and load the torch onto a bus, at the demand of Chinese officials. This was later denied by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, despite video footage broadcast by French television network France 2 which showed Chinese flame attendants extinguishing the torch. Backup flames are with the relay at all times to relight the torch. French judoka and torchbearer David Douillet expressed his annoyance at the Chinese flame attendants who extinguished the torch which he was about to hand over to Teddy Riner: "I understand they're afraid of everything, but this is just annoying. They extinguished the flame despite the fact that there was no risk, and they could see it and they knew it. I don't know why they did it."

bootstrap prompt: The ownership of the Spectre organisation—originally stylised "SPECTRE" as an acronym of SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion—and its characters, had been at the centre of long-standing litigation starting in 1961 between Ian Fleming and Kevin McClory over the film rights to the novel Thunderball. The dispute began after Fleming incorporated elements of an undeveloped film script written by McClory and screenwriter Jack Whittingham—including characters and plot points—into Thunderball, which McClory contested in court, claiming ownership over elements of the novel. In 1963, Fleming settled out of court with McClory, in an agreement which awarded McClory the film rights. This enabled him to become a producer for the 1965 film Thunderball—with Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman as executive producers—and the non-Eon film Never Say Never Again, an updated remake of Thunderball, in 1983.[N 3] A second remake, entitled Warhead 2000 A.D., was planned for production and release in the 1990s before being abandoned.

Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly viewed Spectre as "an overreaction to our current blockbuster moment", aspiring "to be a serialized sequel" and proving "itself as a Saga". While noting that "[n]othing that happens in Spectre holds up to even minor logical scrutiny", he had "come not to bury Spectre, but to weirdly praise it. Because the final act of the movie is so strange, so willfully obtuse, that it deserves extra attention." In a positive review Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, describing "The 24th movie about the British MI6 agent with a license to kill is party time for Bond fans, a fierce, funny, gorgeously produced valentine to the longest-running franchise in movies". Other positive reviews from Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle, gave it a perfect 100 score, stating: “One of the great satisfactions of Spectre is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone’s personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person.” Stephen Whitty from the New York Daily News, gave it an 80 grade, saying: “Craig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn’t leave a huge impression as this film’s “Bond girl,” perhaps it’s because we’ve already met — far too briefly — the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real “Bond woman” since Diana Rigg.” Richard Roeper from the Chicago Sun-Times, gave it a 75 grade. He stated: “This is the 24th Bond film and it ranks solidly in the middle of the all-time rankings, which means it’s still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way.” Michael Phillips over at the Chicago Tribune, gave it a 75 grade. He stated: “For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, “Spectre” works best when everyone’s on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes.” Guy Lodge from Variety, gave it a 70 score, stating: “What’s missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of “Skyfall,” as the film sustains its predecessor’s nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent.”

bootstrap prompt: Authorized headdress for the Canadian Armed Forces are the: beret, wedge cap, ballcap, Yukon cap, and tuque (toque). Each is coloured according to the distinctive uniform worn: navy (white or navy blue), army (rifle green or "regimental" colour), air force (light blue). Adherents of the Sikh faith may wear uniform turbans (dastar) (or patka, when operational) and Muslim women may wear uniform tucked hijabs under their authorized headdress. Jews may wear yarmulke under their authorized headdress and when bareheaded.

bootstrap prompt: Beyoncé's vocal range spans four octaves. Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as "one of the most compelling instruments in popular music". While another critic says she is a "Vocal acrobat, being able to sing long and complex melismas and vocal runs effortlessly, and in key. Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child. The Daily Mail calls Beyoncé's voice "versatile", capable of exploring power ballads, soul, rock belting, operatic flourishes, and hip hop. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is "velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting". Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's strange rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was "capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars."

bootstrap prompt: During the Republic, any person who wished to hold public office had to conform to the Reformed Church and take an oath to this effect. The extent to which different religions or denominations were persecuted depended much on the time period and regional or city leaders. In the beginning, this was especially focused on Roman Catholics, being the religion of the enemy. In 17th-century Leiden, for instance, people opening their homes to services could be fined 200 guilders (a year's wage for a skilled tradesman) and banned from the city. Throughout this, however, personal freedom of religion existed and was one factor – along with economic reasons – in causing large immigration of religious refugees from other parts of Europe.

These four truths explain the nature of dukkha (suffering, anxiety, unsatisfactoriness), its causes, and how it can be overcome. The four truths are:[note 4]
538 | Q score(1.7842): What are the causes of dukkha according to the Four Noble Truths?
538 | A score(1.397): According to the Four Noble Truths, the cause of dukkha is craving or attachment to desire. This craving leads to suffering because it creates a cycle of wanting more and never being satisfied with what we have. It also leads to negative emotions such as anger, jealousy, and fear.[note 5]
539 | Q score(1.6445): How can one overcome craving and attachment according to Buddhist teachings?
539 | A score(1.2745): According to Buddhist teachings, one can overcome craving and attachment by following the Noble Eightfold Path, which includes right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.

bootstrap prompt: In these schools children could be selected on the basis of curriculum aptitude related to the school's specialism even though the schools do take quotas from each quartile of the attainment range to ensure they were not selective by attainment. A problem with this is whether the quotas should be taken from a normal distribution or from the specific distribution of attainment in the immediate catchment area. In the selective school system, which survives in several parts of the United Kingdom, admission is dependent on selection criteria, most commonly a cognitive test or tests. Although comprehensive schools were introduced to England and Wales in 1965, there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation.[citation needed] (though this is a small number compared to approximately 3500 state secondary schools in England). Most comprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 to 16, but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools, and in some places the secondary level is divided into two, for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18, roughly corresponding to the US middle school (or junior high school) and high school, respectively. With the advent of key stages in the National Curriculum some local authorities reverted from the Middle School system to 11–16 and 11–18 schools so that the transition between schools corresponds to the end of one key stage and the start of another.
541 | Q score(1.3594): What are some arguments for and against selective schools?
541 | A score(1.4683): Arguments for selective schools include providing high-quality education and opportunities for gifted students, while arguments against include perpetuating inequality and limiting diversity in the student body.
542 | Q score(1.0703): What are some potential solutions or compromises that could address both the need for providing high-quality education for gifted students and concerns about perpetuating inequality and limiting diversity?
542 | A score(1.8671): One potential solution is to provide gifted education within the framework of comprehensive schools, where all students attend the same school but are provided with different levels of instruction based on their abilities and needs. This can be achieved through ability grouping or tracking, where students are grouped with peers of similar abilities for certain subjects or classes. However,
543 | Q score(2.0654): What are some potential drawbacks or challenges to implementing ability grouping or tracking within comprehensive schools?
543 | A score(1.416): One potential drawback of ability grouping or tracking within comprehensive schools is that it can lead to social segregation among students. Students who are grouped together based on their academic abilities may have different interests and backgrounds, leading to a lack of diversity in the classroom. Additionally, tracking can create a sense of competition among students, which can be detrimental to their learning experience. Another challenge is that tracking can limit opportunities for students to explore new subjects or pursue their passions outside of their assigned track. Finally, tracking can also lead to a disconnect between what students learn in the classroom and how they apply it in real-world situations.

bootstrap prompt: In 1758, the taxonomist Linnaeus published in Systema Naturae a categorization of species which included the Canis species. Canis is a Latin word meaning dog, and the list included the dog-like carnivores: the domestic dog, wolves, foxes and jackals. The dog was classified as Canis familiaris, which means "Dog-family" or the family dog. On the next page he recorded the wolf as Canis lupus, which means "Dog-wolf". In 1978, a review aimed at reducing the number of recognized Canis species proposed that "Canis dingo is now generally regarded as a distinctive feral domestic dog. Canis familiaris is used for domestic dogs, although taxonomically it should probably be synonymous with Canis lupus." In 1982, the first edition of Mammal Species of the World listed Canis familiaris under Canis lupus with the comment: "Probably ancestor of and conspecific with the domestic dog, familiaris. Canis familiaris has page priority over Canis lupus, but both were published simultaneously in Linnaeus (1758), and Canis lupus has been universally used for this species", which avoided classifying the wolf as the family dog. The dog is now listed among the many other Latin-named subspecies of Canis lupus as Canis lupus familiaris.
547 | Q score(1.4443): Why was there a review aimed at reducing the number of recognized Canis species?
547 | A score(1.5605): The review aimed at reducing the number of recognized Canis species because there was a lot of confusion and disagreement among scientists about how to classify and differentiate the different dog-like carnivores. Some researchers believed that many of the different species were actually just subspecies of the same animal, while others argued that the differences between the animals were significant enough to warrant separate species designations. The goal of the review was to try to establish a more consistent and accurate classification system for these animals.
548 | Q score(1.3125): What were some of the challenges faced during the review process?
548 | A score(0.8457): The review process faced several challenges, including the difficulty of determining the exact taxonomic classification of the species, as well as the need to reconcile the different opinions of experts in the field. Additionally, the review process was complicated by the fact that the taxonomic classification of the species had been debated for centuries, and there were many different opinions on the matter.
549 | Q score(0.4961): How did the reviewers address these challenges during the review process?
549 | A score(0.4785): The reviewers addressed these challenges by thoroughly evaluating the methodology, analyzing the results, providing constructive feedback, and suggesting improvements to enhance the study's validity and reliability.

bootstrap prompt: Though the iPod was released in 2001, its price and Mac-only compatibility caused sales to be relatively slow until 2004. The iPod line came from Apple's "digital hub" category, when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices. Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players "big and clunky or small and useless" with user interfaces that were "unbelievably awful," so Apple decided to develop its own. As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs, Apple's hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey, and design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive. Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan, and purchased the rights to it for Apple, and had also already worked out how the screen, battery, and other key elements would work. The aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams, while the wheel based user interface was prompted by Bang & Olufsen's BeoCom 6000 telephone. The product ("the Walkman of the twenty-first century" ) was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23, 2001. Jobs announced it as a Mac-compatible product with a 5 GB hard drive that put "1,000 songs in your pocket."

As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teachings to ensure that no errors occurred in oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, a cousin of the Buddha and his personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses (sūtras, Pāli suttas) of the Buddha, and, according to some sources, the abhidhamma. Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (vinaya). Most scholars regard the traditional accounts of the council as greatly exaggerated if not entirely fictitious.[note 36]Richard Gombrich noted Sariputta led communal recitations of the Buddha's teaching for preservation in the Buddha's lifetime in Sangiti Sutta (Digha Nikaya #33), and something similar to the First Council must have taken place to compose Buddhist scriptures.

bootstrap prompt: Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, "Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child."

641 | A score(0.6172): The contrasting attitudes of the female characters towards gender roles and societal expectations reflect the larger societal issues of racism and classism in the novel. For example, Calpurnia and Miss Maudie both challenge traditional gender roles and expectations, while Mayella Ewell and Mrs. Dubose embody the racist and classist attitudes prevalent in the society. Additionally, the fact that these women have such different perspectives on gender roles and societal expectations shows how complex and varied the issue can be. This complexity is further highlighted through the way in which Scout herself struggles to understand and reconcile these differences.

On his return to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest, and by the end of June 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: "I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away ..." The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover Félicien Mallefille.

bootstrap prompt: The president is the civilian Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States. He has the authority to command them to take appropriate military action in the event of a sudden crisis. However, only the Congress is explicitly granted the power to declare war per se, as well as to raise, fund and maintain the armed forces. Congress also has the duty and authority to prescribe the laws and regulations under which the armed forces operate, such as the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and requires that all Generals and Admirals appointed by the president be confirmed by a majority vote of the Senate before they can assume their office.
712 | Q score(1.8643): What is the significance of Congress having the power to declare war?
712 | A score(1.5113): The power to declare war is a significant power because it is the only power that can be used to authorize the use of military force by the United States. It is a check on the power of the president, who is the Commander in Chief of the armed forces. Congress must approve any military action before it can be taken, and this ensures that the decision to go to war is made by the representatives of the people, rather than by the president alone.
713 | Q score(0.9336): What is the historical significance of the power to declare war?
713 | A score(1.083): The power to declare war is historically significant because it was intentionally granted to Congress by the Founding Fathers as a means of limiting the power of the executive branch. This was done to prevent a single person or small group from unilaterally deciding to go to war, which could have disastrous consequences for the country. It also serves as a check and balance on the president's authority as Commander in Chief.
714 | Q score(1.3945): Has the power to declare war always been effectively exercised by Congress throughout US history?
714 | A score(1.2239): No, the power to declare war has not always been effectively exercised by Congress throughout US history. There have been instances where presidents have taken military action without a formal declaration of war from Congress, such as the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Additionally, Congress has authorized the use of military force without a formal declaration of war, such as in the case of the War on Terror.

bootstrap prompt: Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the Revolutionary Étude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64, No. 1). However, with the exception of his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.
715 | Q score(1.7617): What was Chopin's reasoning for not giving descriptive titles to his instrumental works?
715 | A score(2.1218): Chopin's reasoning for not giving descriptive titles to his instrumental works was to allow the listener to form their own emotional and personal connection to the music without being influenced or limited by a predetermined program or narrative. He believed that music should speak for itself and convey its own meaning through its structure, harmony, and melody.
716 | Q score(1.4482): How did Chopin's approach to titling his instrumental works differ from other composers of his time?
716 | A score(1.9053): Chopin's approach to titling his instrumental works differed from other composers of his time in that he never named his pieces beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener. In contrast, many other composers of his time used descriptive titles for their works, such as Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata and Schumann's Carnaval.
717 | Q score(1.5732): Did Chopin ever explain his reasoning for not giving descriptive titles to his works?
717 | A score(0.9252): As far as I know, there is no record of any explanation from Chopin himself regarding why he chose not to name his works beyond their generic designation. It could be speculated that he felt that the music should speak for itself without any additional descriptors. Additionally, some scholars believe that Chopin may have been reluctant to associate his music with any particular political or social events, preferring instead to let listeners draw their own conclusions about the meaning behind his compositions.

bootstrap prompt: Early reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that "As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential". Others, however, thought that "the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed". It was also described as a "sadistic musical bake-off", and "a romp in humiliation". Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations – Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is "a conniving multimedia monster" that has "absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil". The decision to send the season one winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted sarcastically that "The terrorists have won" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who "gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit. Them and a handful of phone-redialer geeks who have been clocking up to 10,000 calls each week for their contestant of choice (but who, according to Fox, are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome)."

bootstrap prompt: While the number of cardinals was small from the times of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance, and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest, in the 16th century the College expanded markedly. In 1587, Pope Sixtus V sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the College at 70, including 50 cardinal priests, about twice the historical number. This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally when a building fell into disrepair. When Pope John XXIII abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do. Today there are close to 150 titular churches, out of over 300 churches in Rome.
721 | Q score(1.5898): What is the significance of a church being designated as a titular church?
721 | A score(1.4072): A church being designated as a titular church means that it is assigned to a cardinal as his honorary church in Rome. The cardinal is not responsible for the day-to-day administration of the church, but he is expected to celebrate Mass there on certain occasions, such as the feast day of the church's patron saint. The designation of a church as a titular church is a way for the Pope to honor and recognize the cardinal who is assigned to it. Additionally, the church may become a gathering place for the cardinal and his supporters, who may use it as a center for their activities or as a place to meet with other cardinals.
722 | Q score(1.252): How many titular churches are there in Rome?
722 | A score(1.4111): There are currently 168 titular churches in Rome.
723 | Q score(0.0039): What is the significance of being a titular church in Rome?
723 | A score(1.5605): A titular church in Rome is a church that is assigned to a cardinal, who is then referred to as the titular head of the church. It is significant because it is a prestigious position within the Catholic Church and gives the cardinal a role in the governance of the Church in Rome. Additionally, the cardinal is responsible for the care and maintenance of the church and its associated parishioners, as well as for promoting the spiritual and pastoral development of the community.

bootstrap prompt: Tom Robinson is the chief example among several innocents destroyed carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel. However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: "Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'—that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished." The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson states about a character who was misunderstood, "when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things ... Atticus, he was real nice," to which he responds, "Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them."
724 | Q score(2.022): How does the theme of innocence tie into the character development of Scout throughout the novel?
724 | A score(1.5107): The theme of innocence is central to Scout's character development in the novel.

725 | Q score(0.3164): How does Scout's loss of innocence impact her perspective on the world?
725 | A score(1.748): Scout's loss of innocence through witnessing the trial and the events surrounding it leads her to question the fairness and justice of the world. She learns that people can be cruel and unjust, but also that there is goodness and kindness in unexpected places. This realization shapes her perspective on the world and makes her more empathetic and understanding of others.
726 | Q score(0.1836): How does Scout's loss of innocence and newfound perspective affect her relationships with the people around her?
726 | A score(1.5625): Scout's loss of innocence and newfound perspective affect her relationships with the people around her by allowing her to see them in a different light. She begins to understand the complexities of human behavior and the injustices that exist in society. Her relationship with Boo Radley transforms from one of fear and curiosity to one of empathy and understanding, and she gains a deeper appreciation for her father, Atticus.

727 | Q score(0.0508): What is the title of the head of government in the United States?
727 | A score(0.7646): The title of the head of government in the United States is "President". The President is the chief executive of the federal government and is elected to a four-year term. The President is responsible for executing the laws of the United States and is considered the head of state. The President is also the commander-in-chief of the military and has the power to veto laws passed by Congress.
728 | Q score(0.6504): What are some other important responsibilities of the President besides executing laws and serving as commander-in-chief?
728 | A score(0.9335): The President has several other important responsibilities, including:
- Appointing federal judges and other officials with the advice and consent of the Senate
- Making treaties with foreign powers, subject to Senate approval
- Convening Congress in special sessions
- Granting pardons and reprieves
- Representing the United States in international affairs
- Addressing Congress at the beginning of each session and at other times as needed
- Convening the National Security Council and other advisory bodies
- Signing bills passed by Congress into law
- Declaring national emergencies and using the military to enforce laws or suppress disorders
729 | Q score(1.8467): How does the President's power to declare national emergencies and use the military to enforce laws or suppress disorders relate to the concept of checks and balances?
729 | A score(1.9019): The President's ability to declare a national emergency and use the military to enforce laws or suppress disorders relates to the concept of checks and balances because it allows for an additional layer of oversight on the executive branch. Congress can pass legislation that limits the President's authority during a declared state of emergency, and the Supreme Court can review any actions taken by the President under such circumstances. This helps ensure that the President cannot abuse their powers and act unilaterally without proper oversight from other branches of government.

Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as "one of the most compelling instruments in popular music". While another critic says she is a "Vocal acrobat, being able to sing long and complex melismas and vocal runs effortlessly, and in key. Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child. The Daily Mail calls Beyoncé's voice "versatile", capable of exploring power ballads, soul, rock belting, operatic flourishes, and hip hop. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is "velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting". Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's strange rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was "capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars."

bootstrap prompt: Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the Solar Total Energy Project (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400 kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401 kW steam and 468 kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage. Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation. The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from sea water is one of the oldest applications of solar energy. Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams. Clothes lines, clotheshorses, and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas. In some states of the United States legislation protects the "right to dry" clothes. Unglazed transpired collectors (UTC) are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air. UTCs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22 °C (40 °F) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45–60 °C (113–140 °F). The short payback period of transpired collectors (3 to 12 years) makes them a more cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems. As of 2003, over 80 systems with a combined collector area of 35,000 square metres (380,000 sq ft) had been installed worldwide, including an 860 m2 (9,300 sq ft) collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1,300 m2 (14,000 sq ft) collector in Coimbatore, India, used for drying marigolds.

bootstrap prompt: Helmut Hoffman states that the Ming upheld the facade of rule over Tibet through periodic missions of "tribute emissaries" to the Ming court and by granting nominal titles to ruling lamas, but did not actually interfere in Tibetan governance. Melvyn C. Goldstein writes that the Ming had no real administrative authority over Tibet, as the various titles given to Tibetan leaders did not confer authority as the earlier Mongol Yuan titles had. He asserts that "by conferring titles on Tibetans already in power, the Ming emperors merely recognized political reality." Hugh Edward Richardson writes that the Ming dynasty exercised no authority over the succession of Tibetan ruling families, the Phagmodru (1354–1435), Rinpungpa (1435–1565), and Tsangpa (1565–1642).
757 | Q score(2.4988): What was the significance of the Ming dynasty's recognition of Tibetan rulers through the granting of titles?
757 | A score(2.4624): The granting of titles by the Ming dynasty to Tibetan rulers was a symbol of diplomatic recognition and a way to maintain a friendly relationship with Tibet.

bootstrap prompt: Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 °C. By photosynthesis green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.

bootstrap prompt: Courts check both the executive branch and the legislative branch through judicial review. This concept is not written into the Constitution, but was envisioned by many of the Constitution's Framers (for example, The Federalist Papers mention it). The Supreme Court established a precedent for judicial review in Marbury v. Madison. There were protests by some at this decision, born chiefly of political expediency, but political realities in the particular case paradoxically restrained opposing views from asserting themselves. For this reason, precedent alone established the principle that a court may strike down a law it deems unconstitutional.

820 | A score(1.4529): The power of judicial review allows courts to check the actions of the other two branches of government. It can be seen as an important tool in maintaining the balance of power between the branches. By allowing courts to strike down laws they deem unconstitutional, it ensures that no one branch has too much power over the others. Additionally, it helps to ensure that the Constitution is upheld and that the rights of citizens are protected.

bootstrap prompt: Solar water disinfection (SODIS) involves exposing water-filled plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles to sunlight for several hours. Exposure times vary depending on weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions. It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage. Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water.
844 | Q score(2.3384): What are some advantages of using solar water disinfection?
844 | A score(0.8984): Some advantages of using solar water disinfection are that it is low-cost, easy to use, and does not require electricity or special equipment. It is also effective in reducing the presence of harmful bacteria and viruses in water, making it a viable option for households in developing countries with limited access to clean water sources.
845 | Q score(2.4092): What are some limitations or challenges of using solar water disinfection?
845 | A score(0.9487): One limitation of SODIS is that it requires direct sunlight, which may not be available at all times due to cloud cover or other factors. Additionally, the process can take up to 4 hours, so it may not be suitable for emergency situations where immediate access to clean water is needed. Another challenge is that the PET bottle must be clear and free of any contaminants such as dirt or bacteria. Finally, the process does not remove chemicals or heavy metals from the water, so it should only be used for drinking water.
846 | Q score(1.4365): What are some potential solutions to overcome these limitations?
846 | A score(0.6736): Some potential solutions to overcome the limitations of SODIS include using larger containers to treat water for families or communities, using reflective surfaces to increase the amount of sunlight exposure, and implementing education and awareness programs to increase the adoption and proper use of the SODIS method. Additionally, combining SODIS with other water treatment methods, such as filtration or chlorination, can also improve the effectiveness of the overall treatment process.

bootstrap prompt: Most breeds of dog are at most a few hundred years old, having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for specific functional roles. Through this selective breeding, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal. For example, height measured to the withers ranges from 15.2 centimetres (6.0 in) in the Chihuahua to about 76 cm (30 in) in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth. It is common for most breeds to shed this coat.
847 | Q score(0.9951): What factors contributed to the development of so many different dog breeds?
847 | A score(1.2595): The development of different dog breeds was primarily driven by human selection for desired traits such as size, coat type, temperament, and working ability. Over time, breeders have focused on specific traits for different purposes such as hunting, herding, guarding, and companionship. The geographic isolation of certain regions also contributed to the development of distinct breeds. Additionally, technological advancements and changes in society have led to changes in the function and role of dogs, resulting in the creation of new breeds that meet those needs.
848 | Q score(1.5498): What are some examples of newer dog breeds that have been developed to meet changing societal needs?
848 | A score(0.46): Some examples of newer dog breeds developed to meet changing societal needs include the Labradoodle, which was bred to be hypoallergenic and have the temperament of a Labrador Retriever with the coat of a Poodle, and the Goldendoodle, which was bred to be a friendly and intelligent family dog with a hypoallergenic coat. Another example is the American Bully, which was bred as a companion dog with a muscular build and gentle temperament.
849 | Q score(1.5742): What are some potential drawbacks or concerns associated with developing new dog breeds for specific societal needs?
849 | A score(1.4666): Developing new dog breeds for specific societal needs can lead to inbreeding and genetic disorders due to a limited gene pool.

bootstrap prompt: In 1565, the powerful Rinbung princes were overthrown by one of their own ministers, Karma Tseten who styled himself as the Tsangpa, "the one of Tsang", and established his base of power at Shigatse. The second successor of this first Tsang king, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, took control of the whole of Central Tibet (Ü-Tsang), reigning from 1611–1621. Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa still claimed their allegiance to the Phagmodru as well as the Gelug, while the Ü-Tsang king allied with the Karmapa. Tensions rose between the nationalistic Ü-Tsang ruler and the Mongols who safeguarded their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The fourth Dalai Lama refused to give an audience to the Ü-Tsang king, which sparked a conflict as the latter began assaulting Gelug monasteries. Chen writes of the speculation over the fourth Dalai Lama's mysterious death and the plot of the Ü-Tsang king to have him murdered for "cursing" him with illness, although Chen writes that the murder was most likely the result of a feudal power struggle. In 1618, only two years after Yonten Gyatso died, the Gelug and the Karma Kargyu went to war, the Karma Kargyu supported by the secular Ü-Tsang king. The Ü-Tsang ruler had a large number of Gelugpa lamas killed, occupied their monasteries at Drepung and Sera, and outlawed any attempts to find another Dalai Lama. In 1621, the Ü-Tsang king died and was succeeded by his young son Karma Tenkyong, an event which stymied the war effort as the latter accepted the six-year-old Lozang Gyatso as the new Dalai Lama. Despite the new Dalai Lama's diplomatic efforts to maintain friendly relations with the new Ü-Tsang ruler, Sonam Rapten (1595–1657), the Dalai Lama's chief steward and treasurer at Drepung, made efforts to overthrow the Ü-Tsang king, which led to another conflict. In 1633, the Gelugpas and several thousand Mongol adherents defeated the Ü-Tsang king's troops near Lhasa before a peaceful negotiation was settled. Goldstein writes that in this the "Mongols were again playing a significant role in Tibetan affairs, this time as the military arm of the Dalai Lama."

Thinley writes that before the Karmapa returned to Tibet, the Yongle Emperor began planning to send a military force into Tibet to forcibly give the Karmapa authority over all the Tibetan Buddhist schools but Deshin Shekpa dissuaded him. However, Hok-Lam Chan states that "there is little evidence that this was ever the emperor's intention" and that evidence indicates that Deshin Skekpa was invited strictly for religious purposes.

bootstrap prompt: Strict separation of powers did not operate in The United Kingdom, the political structure of which served in most instances[citation needed] as a model for the government created by the U.S. Constitution.[citation needed] Under the UK Westminster system, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, Parliament (consisting of the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), House of Lords and House of Commons) was the supreme lawmaking authority. The executive branch acted in the name of the King ("His Majesty's Government"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other. Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The President of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as Vice Presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers. Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of government "separate and distinct."

Additionally, the US Constitution establishes a separation of powers among the three branches of government, while the UK does not have such a strong emphasis on this principle. Finally, the US Constitution includes a Bill of Rights, which protects individual rights from government interference, while the UK does not have a similar document.

950 | A score(0.6055): The US tends to take a more interventionist approach to foreign policy, often using military force to achieve its goals, while the UK has traditionally taken a more diplomatic approach, prioritizing alliances and soft power. Additionally, the US has a much larger military budget than the UK and tends to act unilaterally, while the UK often works within the framework of international organizations like the UN and NATO.
951 | Q score(1.1328): How has this difference in approach affected the relationship between the US and UK in terms of foreign policy and international relations?
951 | A score(0.2778): The differences in approaches to separation of powers have had an impact on the relationship between the US and UK in terms of foreign policy and international relations. For example, the UK has traditionally been more willing to engage in multilateral institutions such as the European Union, while the US has tended to prioritize bilateral relationships. Additionally, the UK has historically been more willing to engage in military interventions abroad than the US, although this has changed somewhat since the Iraq War. However, despite these differences, the US and UK have maintained close diplomatic and economic ties throughout their history.

The UK's Westminster system is based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, whereas the US Constitution establishes a separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. This difference in approach has led to some tension between the two countries over issues such as surveillance and data privacy.

In general, however, the US and UK have shared common values and interests in areas such as human rights, democracy, and free trade. They have

bootstrap prompt: The two mature piano sonatas (No. 2, Op. 35, written in 1839 and No. 3, Op. 58, written in 1844) are in four movements. In Op. 35, Chopin was able to combine within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique—"a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the German sonata principle". The last movement, a brief (75-bar) perpetuum mobile in which the hands play in unmodified octave unison throughout, was found shocking and unmusical by contemporaries, including Schumann. The Op. 58 sonata is closer to the German tradition, including many passages of complex counterpoint, "worthy of Brahms" according to the music historians Kornel Michałowski and Jim Samson.

bootstrap prompt: At the end of 1831, Chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when Robert Schumann, reviewing the Op. 2 Variations in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung (his first published article on music), declared: "Hats off, gentlemen! A genius." On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert at the Salle Pleyel which drew universal admiration. The critic François-Joseph Fétis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: "Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ..." After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe.

The doctrine of anattā (Sanskrit anātman) rejects the concepts of a permanent self or an unchanging, eternal soul, as it is called in Hinduism and Christianity. According to Buddhism there ultimately is no such thing as a self independent from the rest of the universe. Buddhists also refer to themselves as the believers of the anatta doctrine—Nairatmyavadin or Anattavadin. Rebirth in subsequent existences must be understood as the continuation of a dynamic, ever-changing process of pratītyasamutpāda ("dependent arising") determined by the laws of cause and effect (karma) rather than that of one being, reincarnating from one existence to the next.

bootstrap prompt: Some in the entertainment industry were critical of the star-making aspect of the show. Usher, a mentor on the show, bemoaning the loss of the "true art form of music", thought that shows like American Idol made it seem "so easy that everyone can do it, and that it can happen overnight", and that "television is a lie". Musician Michael Feinstein, while acknowledging that the show had uncovered promising performers, said that American Idol "isn't really about music. It's about all the bad aspects of the music business – the arrogance of commerce, this sense of 'I know what will make this person a star; artists themselves don't know.' " That American Idol is seen to be a fast track to success for its contestants has been a cause of resentment for some in the industry. LeAnn Rimes, commenting on Carrie Underwood winning Best Female Artist in Country Music Awards over Faith Hill in 2006, said that "Carrie has not paid her dues long enough to fully deserve that award". It is a common theme that has been echoed by many others. Elton John, who had appeared as a mentor in the show but turned down an offer to be a judge on American Idol, commenting on talent shows in general, said that "there have been some good acts but the only way to sustain a career is to pay your dues in small clubs".

bootstrap prompt: Deciduous trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.

bootstrap prompt: From 1721 this was the Whig politician Robert Walpole, who held office for twenty-one years. Walpole chaired cabinet meetings, appointed all the other ministers, dispensed the royal patronage and packed the House of Commons with his supporters. Under Walpole, the doctrine of cabinet solidarity developed. Walpole required that no minister other than himself have private dealings with the king, and also that when the cabinet had agreed on a policy, all ministers must defend it in public, or resign. As a later prime minister, Lord Melbourne, said, "It matters not what we say, gentlemen, so long as we all say the same thing."
1063 | Q score(1.916): What was the significance of the doctrine of cabinet solidarity?

bootstrap prompt: Vehicles typically include headlamps and tail lights. Headlamps are white or selective yellow lights placed in the front of the vehicle, designed to illuminate the upcoming road and to make the vehicle more visible. Many manufactures are turning to LED headlights as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional headlamps. Tail and brake lights are red and emit light to the rear so as to reveal the vehicle's direction of travel to following drivers. White rear-facing reversing lamps indicate that the vehicle's transmission has been placed in the reverse gear, warning anyone behind the vehicle that it is moving backwards, or about to do so. Flashing turn signals on the front, side, and rear of the vehicle indicate an intended change of position or direction. In the late 1950s, some automakers began to use electroluminescent technology to backlight their cars' speedometers and other gauges or to draw attention to logos or other decorative elements.

bootstrap prompt: Where Congress does not make great and sweeping delegations of its authority, the Supreme Court has been less stringent. One of the earliest cases involving the exact limits of non-delegation was Wayman v. Southard 23 U.S. (10 Wet.) 1, 42 (1825). Congress had delegated to the courts the power to prescribe judicial procedure; it was contended that Congress had thereby unconstitutionally clothed the judiciary with legislative powers. While Chief Justice John Marshall conceded that the determination of rules of procedure was a legislative function, he distinguished between "important" subjects and mere details. Marshall wrote that "a general provision may be made, and power given to those who are to act under such general provisions, to fill up the details."
1099 | Q score(1.9785): How does the concept of filling up details relate to the interpretation of laws and regulations?
1099 | A score(0.8086): The concept of filling up details refers to the power given to those who are to act under a general provision to make rules or regulations to implement and interpret the law. This power allows for flexibility in the application of laws and regulations, as those who are implementing them can make adjustments and clarifications to better fit the specific circumstances they are dealing with.

1101 | A score(0.9912): The non-delegation doctrine is a principle in constitutional law that limits the power of Congress to delegate its legislative authority to other branches or agencies of government. It is significant in the United States government because it helps to maintain the separation of powers and prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.

bootstrap prompt: Scholars argue that Lee's approach to class and race was more complex "than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to 'poor white trash' ... Lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice, silence the voices that might challenge the existing order, and greatly complicate many Americans' conception of the causes of racism and segregation." Lee's use of the middle-class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader, regardless of class or cultural background, and fosters a sense of nostalgia. Sharing Scout and Jem's perspective, the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative antebellum Mrs. Dubose; the lower-class Ewells, and the Cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways; the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond; and Calpurnia and other members of the black community. The children internalize Atticus' admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person's skin, gaining a greater understanding of people's motives and behavior.
1102 | Q score(2.0762): How does Lee's use of the middle-class narrative voice contribute to the novel's themes of class and race?
1102 | A score(0.9004): Lee's use of the middle-class narrative voice in the novel contributes to the exploration of themes of class and race by highlighting the intersectionality of these identities. The narrator's experiences and observations provide insight into the ways in which race and class intersect, and how they shape the characters' lives and relationships. Additionally, the use of this voice allows Lee to comment on the middle-class values and attitudes towards race and class, providing a critique of the ways in which these values can perpetuate inequality.
1103 | Q score(1.0488): Can you provide an example from the novel that demonstrates the intersectionality of race and class through the middle-class narrative voice?
1103 | A score(0.8594): One example is when Scout and Jem visit the Ewells' home for the first time. They notice that the house is filthy and run down, but also realize that the family has no money to fix it up. This contrast between their own comfortable lifestyle and the Ewells' poverty highlights the disparity between classes and the way that this affects their perceptions of each other. Additionally, the Ewells' lack of education and social status makes them seem less intelligent than the Finch children, reinforcing the idea that education and wealth are closely linked to intelligence.
1104 | Q score(0.416): What does the author suggest about the relationship between education and wealth?

bootstrap prompt: Comprehensive schools are primarily about providing an entitlement curriculum to all children, without selection whether due to financial considerations or attainment. A consequence of that is a wider ranging curriculum, including practical subjects such as design and technology and vocational learning, which were less common or non-existent in grammar schools. Providing post-16 education cost-effectively becomes more challenging for smaller comprehensive schools, because of the number of courses needed to cover a broader curriculum with comparatively fewer students. This is why schools have tended to get larger and also why many local authorities have organised secondary education into 11–16 schools, with the post-16 provision provided by Sixth Form colleges and Further Education Colleges. Comprehensive schools do not select their intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude, but there are demographic reasons why the attainment profiles of different schools vary considerably. In addition, government initiatives such as the City Technology Colleges and Specialist schools programmes have made the comprehensive ideal less certain.
1141 | Q score(2.1182): What are some of the challenges faced by comprehensive schools in providing a broad and balanced curriculum for all students?
1141 | A score(1.6579): Comprehensive schools face challenges in providing a broad and balanced curriculum for all students due to factors such as limited resources, time constraints, and varying student abilities and interests. The need to meet academic standards and prepare students for exams can also result in a narrow focus on core subjects, potentially limiting opportunities for creative and vocational subjects. Additionally, there may be a lack of qualified teachers in certain subject areas, particularly in more remote or economically disadvantaged areas.
1142 | Q score(1.0771): What steps can schools take to address the challenges of providing a broad and balanced curriculum for all students?
1142 | A score(0.9658): Schools can address the challenges of providing a broad and balanced curriculum for all students by implementing a flexible and personalized approach to learning, providing access to a wide range of resources and technologies, offering extracurricular activities, and promoting interdisciplinary learning and collaboration among teachers. Additionally, schools can prioritize professional development for teachers to ensure they have the skills and knowledge necessary to teach a diverse range of subjects and engage with students of different backgrounds and abilities.

1143 | A score(1.1392): Schools can ensure that students from diverse backgrounds and abilities are equally able to access and benefit from the resources and opportunities provided by implementing inclusive policies and practices. This includes providing additional support for students who need it, such as English language learners or students with disabilities, and offering a range of extracurricular activities to cater to different interests and abilities. It is also important to promote a culture of respect and understanding, where all students feel valued and supported.

bootstrap prompt: Discussions of strategy in the mid Ming dynasty focused primarily on recovery of the Ordos region, which the Mongols used as a rallying base to stage raids into Ming China. Norbu states that the Ming dynasty, preoccupied with the Mongol threat to the north, could not spare additional armed forces to enforce or back up their claim of sovereignty over Tibet; instead, they relied on "Confucian instruments of tribute relations" of heaping unlimited number of titles and gifts on Tibetan lamas through acts of diplomacy. Sperling states that the delicate relationship between the Ming and Tibet was "the last time a united China had to deal with an independent Tibet," that there was a potential for armed conflict at their borders, and that the ultimate goal of Ming foreign policy with Tibet was not subjugation but "avoidance of any kind of Tibetan threat." P. Christiaan Klieger argues that the Ming court's patronage of high Tibetan lamas "was designed to help stabilize border regions and protect trade routes."

Additionally, the Ming dynasty gained prestige among other nations due to its close relationship with Tibet. On the other hand, Tibet also benefitted from the Ming dynasty's patronage, as it allowed them to maintain their independence and autonomy while still being able to interact with the outside world. Furthermore, the Ming dynasty's support helped to preserve Tibetan Buddhism and culture, which would have been threatened if the Mongols had taken control of Tibet.

bootstrap prompt: Authorized headdress for the Canadian Armed Forces are the: beret, wedge cap, ballcap, Yukon cap, and tuque (toque). Each is coloured according to the distinctive uniform worn: navy (white or navy blue), army (rifle green or "regimental" colour), air force (light blue). Adherents of the Sikh faith may wear uniform turbans (dastar) (or patka, when operational) and Muslim women may wear uniform tucked hijabs under their authorized headdress. Jews may wear yarmulke under their authorized headdress and when bareheaded. The beret is probably the most widely worn headgear and is worn with almost all orders of dress (with the exception of the more formal orders of Navy and Air Force dress), and the colour of which is determined by the wearer's environment, branch, or mission.

In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus. Various small Iranian languages in the Pamirs survive that are derived from Eastern Iranian.

bootstrap prompt: For a period ending in the mid-20th century, long-serving cardinal priests were entitled to fill vacancies that arose among the cardinal bishops, just as cardinal deacons of ten years' standing are still entitled to become cardinal priests. Since then, cardinals have been advanced to cardinal bishop exclusively by papal appointment.
1234 | Q score(0.4688): What was the reason behind the change in the process of appointing cardinal bishops?
1234 | A score(0.7344): There is no clear reason given for the change in the process of appointing cardinal bishops, but it is likely due to a desire for more centralized control over the appointment of high-ranking officials in the Catholic Church.
1235 | Q score(0.8789): How might this change in the process of appointing cardinal bishops affect the power dynamics within the Catholic Church?
1235 | A score(1.3203): The change could potentially shift the balance of power away from the cardinal bishops and towards the pope. This would allow the pope to more easily appoint his own allies or supporters to the College of Cardinals, which could lead to a more cohesive and loyal group of advisors. However, it could also result in a lack of diversity and representation within the College of Cardinals, as the pope may be less likely to consider candidates who do not share his political views or priorities. Additionally, it could lead to increased tensions between the pope and the cardinal bishops, as the latter may feel marginalized or disempowered by the changes.
1236 | Q score(2.541): What are some potential consequences of this change?
1236 | A score(0.8916): One potential consequence of this change is that it gives the pope more control over the selection of cardinal bishops, potentially allowing for a more unified and cohesive leadership within the College of Cardinals. However, it also means that there may be less opportunity for experienced and long-serving cardinal priests to advance to the position of cardinal bishop.

bootstrap prompt: In 1897, Frank Shuman, a U.S. inventor, engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.

He had to rely on his own personal wealth and investments from a few wealthy individuals to finance his research and development. Additionally, the technology and materials available at the time were not as advanced as they are today, which made it difficult to create an efficient and cost-effective solar power system.
1239 | Q score(0.7793): How did Frank Shuman's lack of funding and limited technology impact the widespread adoption of solar power during his time?
1239 | A score(1.7313): Frank Shuman's lack of funding and limited technology had a significant impact on the widespread adoption of solar power during his time. Without adequate resources, it was difficult for him to scale up his solar power plant designs and make them commercially viable. Additionally, the limited technology available at the time meant that solar power was not as efficient or cost-effective as other forms of energy production. This made it difficult for Shuman to compete with more established energy sources such as coal and oil.

bootstrap prompt: An article in Science suggested that the construction and filling of the Zipingpu Dam may have triggered the earthquake. The chief engineer of the Sichuan Geology and Mineral Bureau said that the sudden shift of a huge quantity of water into the region could have relaxed the tension between the two sides of the fault, allowing them to move apart, and could have increased the direct pressure on it, causing a violent rupture. The effect was "25 times more" than a year's worth of natural stress from tectonic movement.

bootstrap prompt: Beyoncé's vocal range spans four octaves. Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as "one of the most compelling instruments in popular music". While another critic says she is a "Vocal acrobat, being able to sing long and complex melismas and vocal runs effortlessly, and in key. Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child. The Daily Mail calls Beyoncé's voice "versatile", capable of exploring power ballads, soul, rock belting, operatic flourishes, and hip hop. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is "velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting". Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's strange rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was "capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars."

1312 | A score(0.6289): One of the main challenges in writing a biography of the Buddha with limited historically sound information is the difficulty in separating fact from legend and myth. Additionally, the lack of reliable sources makes it hard to verify the accuracy of the information that is available, and to construct a coherent and complete narrative of the Buddha's life and teachings. Another challenge is the need to approach the subject matter with sensitivity and respect, given the Buddha's status as a revered spiritual figure in many cultures and traditions.

1317 | A score(0.975): The use of alternative catalogue designations instead of opus numbers in the Kobylańska Catalogue is significant because Chopin did not always assign opus numbers to his works, and some of his works were published posthumously. The alternative catalogue designations provide a more comprehensive and accurate way of identifying and organizing Chopin's works than relying solely on opus numbers. The Kobylańska Catalogue includes all of Chopin's known works, including those without opus numbers, as well as different versions and arrangements of his compositions.

AllMusic editor Jason Birchmeier writes of his impact, "As his career progressed throughout the early 21st century, West shattered certain stereotypes about rappers, becoming a superstar on his own terms without adapting his appearance, his rhetoric, or his music to fit any one musical mold." Jon Caramanic of The New York Times said that West has been "a frequent lightning rod for controversy, a bombastic figure who can count rankling two presidents among his achievements, along with being a reliably dyspeptic presence at award shows (when he attends them)." Village Voice Media senior editor Ben Westhoff dubbed him the greatest hip hop artist of all time, writing that "he's made the best albums and changed the game the most, and his music is the most likely to endure," while Complex called him the 21st century's "most important artist of any art form, of any genre."

Every other province had the freedom to regulate the religious question as it wished, although the Union stated every person should be free in the choice of personal religion and that no person should be prosecuted based on religious choice. William of Orange had been a strong supporter of public and personal freedom of religion and hoped to unite Protestants and Catholics in the new union, and, for him, the Union was a defeat. In practice, Catholic services in all provinces were quickly forbidden, and the Reformed Church became the "public" or "privileged" church in the Republic.

1325 | A score(1.6748): The Union of Utrecht's religious policies had a significant impact on the religious landscape of the Netherlands. It led to the persecution of Catholics and the establishment of the Dutch Reformed Church as the "privileged" or "public" church. This led to a significant decline in the number of Catholics in the Netherlands, and the Dutch Reformed Church became the dominant religious institution in the country. Additionally, the Union of Utrecht established a precedent for the separation of church and state in the Netherlands, which has had a lasting impact on the country's political and legal system.
1326 | Q score(1.7744): What were the consequences of the Dutch Reformed Church becoming the "privileged" or "public" church?

This led to resentment among those who did not belong to the Dutch Reformed Church, especially among the Roman Catholic minority. It also created tensions between the Dutch Reformed Church and other churches, such as the Lutheran Church, which were not recognized by the state. Additionally, the privileging of the Dutch Reformed Church contributed to the growth of secularization in the Netherlands, as people increasingly turned away from organized religion.

bootstrap prompt: The College Dropout was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number two on the Billboard 200 as his debut single, "Through the Wire" peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks. "Slow Jamz", his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even bigger success: it became the three musicians' first number one hit. The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. "Jesus Walks", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio. The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, partly because of the acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.

bootstrap prompt: The central government estimates that over 7,000 inadequately engineered schoolrooms collapsed in the earthquake. Chinese citizens have since invented a catch phrase: "tofu-dregs schoolhouses" (Chinese: 豆腐渣校舍), to mock both the quality and the quantity of these inferior constructions that killed so many school children. Due to the one-child policy, many families lost their only child when schools in the region collapsed during the earthquake. Consequently, Sichuan provincial and local officials have lifted the restriction for families whose only child was either killed or severely injured in the disaster. So-called "illegal children" under 18 years of age may be registered as legal replacements for their dead siblings; if the dead child was illegal, no further outstanding fines would apply. Reimbursement would not, however, be offered for fines that were already levied.

bootstrap prompt: Since the 1988 Education Reform Act, parents have a right to choose which school their child should go to or whether to not send them to school at all and to home educate them instead. The concept of "school choice" introduces the idea of competition between state schools, a fundamental change to the original "neighbourhood comprehensive" model, and is partly intended as a means by which schools that are perceived to be inferior are forced either to improve or, if hardly anyone wants to go there, to close down. Government policy is currently promoting 'specialisation' whereby parents choose a secondary school appropriate for their child's interests and skills. Most initiatives focus on parental choice and information, implementing a pseudo-market incentive to encourage better schools. This logic has underpinned the controversial league tables of school performance.
1357 | Q score(1.5156): What do you think about the idea of school choice?
1357 | A score(0.6992): As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information about the concept of school choice. School choice is a controversial topic, with proponents arguing that it provides parents with more options and drives competition, leading to improved educational outcomes. Opponents argue that it exacerbates inequality, as parents with more resources are better able to exercise their choice, and that it undermines the traditional role of public education as a means of promoting social cohesion.

However, some drawbacks may include increased segregation, reduced funding for public schools, and limited access for disadvantaged families who may not have the resources to participate in school choice programs.

bootstrap prompt: Sessions for West's sixth solo effort begin to take shape in early 2013 in his own personal loft's living room at a Paris hotel. Determined to "undermine the commercial", he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music.

bootstrap prompt: The novel is cited as a factor in the success of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, however, in that it "arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions (of) the accelerating civil rights movement". Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them. Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book's effectiveness is that it "inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion" and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set. Young views the novel as "an act of humanity" in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices. Alabama author Mark Childress compares it to the impact of Uncle Tom's Cabin, a book that is popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War. Childress states the novel "gives white Southerners a way to understand the racism that they've been brought up with and to find another way. And most white people in the South were good people. Most white people in the South were not throwing bombs and causing havoc ... I think the book really helped them come to understand what was wrong with the system in the way that any number of treatises could never do, because it was popular art, because it was told from a child's point of view."

bootstrap prompt: Meanwhile, the Tumed Mongols began moving into the Kokonor region (modern Qinghai), raiding the Ming Chinese frontier and even as far as the suburbs of Beijing under Altan Khan (1507–1582). Klieger writes that Altan Khan's presence in the west effectively reduced Ming influence and contact with Tibet. After Altan Khan made peace with the Ming dynasty in 1571, he invited the third hierarch of the Gelug—Sönam Gyatso (1543–1588)—to meet him in Amdo (modern Qinghai) in 1578, where he accidentally bestowed him and his two predecessors with the title of Dalai Lama—"Ocean Teacher". The full title was "Dalai Lama Vajradhara", "Vajradhara" meaning "Holder of the Thunderbolt" in Sanskrit. Victoria Huckenpahler notes that Vajradhara is considered by Buddhists to be the primordial Buddha of limitless and all-pervasive beneficial qualities, a being that "represents the ultimate aspect of enlightenment." Goldstein writes that Sönam Gyatso also enhanced Altan Khan's standing by granting him the title "king of religion, majestic purity".

Schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted the composer's strong feelings for his native Poland, writing that "Now that the Poles are in deep mourning [after the failure of the November 1830 rising], their appeal to us artists is even stronger ... If the mighty autocrat in the north [i.e. Nicholas I of Russia] could know that in Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music. Chopin's works are cannon buried in flowers!"

 China: In China, the torch was first welcomed by Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang and State Councilor Liu Yandong. It was subsequently passed onto CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao. A call to boycott French hypermart Carrefour from May 1 began spreading through mobile text messaging and online chat rooms amongst the Chinese over the weekend from April 12, accusing the company's major shareholder, the LVMH Group, of donating funds to the Dalai Lama. There were also calls to extend the boycott to include French luxury goods and cosmetic products. According to the Washington Times on April 15, however, the Chinese government was attempting to "calm the situation" through censorship: "All comments posted on popular Internet forum Sohu.com relating to a boycott of Carrefour have been deleted." Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. Some burned French flags, some added Nazism's Swastika to the French flag, and spread short online messages calling for large protests in front of French consulates and embassy. The Carrefour boycott was met with anti-boycott demonstrators who insisted on entering one of the Carrefour stores in Kunming, only to be blocked by boycotters wielding large Chinese flags and hit by water bottles. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao.
