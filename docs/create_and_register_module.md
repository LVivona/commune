Yo, listen up! I'm about to drop some updated knowledge on how to create a dope module and register it on the blockchain. Here's the revised step-by-step guide:

1. **Create Your Module**: Start by creating your own module in Python. It can be anything you want - a model, a service, or some sick functionality. Make sure your module is ready to rock and roll.

```bash
c new_module model.gpt2000
```
This creates a module in commune/modules/model/gpt2000 with a yaml and python file.

2. **Import Commune**: Import the Commune library into your Python code. You'
```python
import commune as c
class Gpt2000(c.Module):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.set_config(kwargs=kwargs)
        # Your module initialization code goes here

    def some_cool_function(self):
        # Your module's cool functionality goes here
        return "I'm bringing the heat!"
```

4. **Register Your Module**: Now it's time to register your module on the network. You have the option to specify a custom name and tag for your module. If you don't provide a custom name, the module will default to the module path. The tag is optional and can be used for versioning or categorization purposes.

**Note**
Before registering, make sure that you have at least one port exposed for the module to recieve and send external traffic. This is important for the validators to reach you. To register your module with a custom name and tag, run the following command:

```bash
c register Gpt2000
```

This will create a key that is called Gpt2000, if you want to add a tag do this.
This may be needed if someone has the same name as you on the network.

```bash
c register Gpt2000 tag=A # name will be Gpt2000::A
```

To change the name entirely
```

If you prefer to use the default module path as the name, simply omit the `name` parameter:

```bash
c register my_module_path tag=1
```

That's it, my friend! You've created a dope module and registered it on the blockchain with the option to customize the name and tag. Now you can share your module with the world and let others benefit from your greatness. Keep on coding and stay fresh!
