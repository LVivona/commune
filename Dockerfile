```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js 14 image as the base
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the Next.js application
RUN npm run build

# Expose the port that the Next.js application will run on (default is 3000)
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the Next.js application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

# Comments:
1. This Dockerfile is specifically designed to run a Next.js package. It uses the official Node.js 14 image as the base, which includes the necessary Node.js and npm tools.
2. The working directory is set to `/app`, which is where the application code will be located.
3. The `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files are copied to the container, and the dependencies are installed using `npm ci` (which is faster than `npm install` for production builds).
4. The rest of the application code is copied to the container.
5. The Next.js application is built using `npm run build`.
6. The port `3000` is exposed, which is the default port for a Next.js application.
7. The container is started with the `npm start` command, which will run the Next.js application.
