## Deploying a Validator Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy a validator on the network and perform various tasks related to staking, registration, and validation.

### Step 1: Starting the Dashboard

To start the dashboard, use the following command:

```bash
c dash
```

### Step 2: Registering a Validator

To register a validator with a specific tag, use the following CLI command:

```bash
c register vali tag=whadup
```

This creates a key with "vali::whadup". 



### Step 3: Staking Your Validator

Ensure that you have staked your validator by following these steps:

1. Stake your validator with another key using the CLI command:

   ```bash
   c stake {keywithbalance} vali::whadup {amount}
   ```

   The default amount to be staked is your entire balance. If you don't have a balance, you'll need to unstake.

2. If needed, you can unstake by using the following command:

   ```bash
   c unstake {keywithnobalance} {amount}
   ```

### Step 4: Understanding Threading and Validation

By default, this process starts 50 threads, with each thread running an asyncio loop to query a group of miners. This allows you to query 50 miners per second, meaning a miner can scan a chain of 1k nodes every 20 seconds. By having multiple threads, you can achieve fast validation and efficiently filter good nodes.

That's it! You've successfully learned how to deploy a validator, register it with a specific tag, stake it, and understand the threading process for efficient validation on the network.

Remember to replace placeholders like `{keywithbalance}`, `{keywithnobalance}`, and `{amount}` with actual values relevant to your setup.

Feel free to explore more advanced features and customization options based on your network's requirements.

Happy validating! ðŸŒŸ
