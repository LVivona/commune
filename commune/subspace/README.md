# Subspace

Subspace is our blockchain that is used for several things:
- **DNS for Python**: Decentralized Name Service for deployed object
- **Evaluating Performance through Voting**: Stake weighted voting system for users to evaluate each other instead of self-reported networks. This provides users with an idea of the "best" models. 
- **Subnets**: The ability for users to create their own subnetworks to tackle a specific problem. This is in addition to the default subnet (commune, netuid: 0)
-**IBC for bridging with any Chain (Coming Soon)**
- **Smart Contracts (Coming Soon)**: We intend to support
